            Hey there, I'm Jamaria! A full stack developer on a
            mission to change the world line by line. I like to
            refer coding as magic because with coding, anything is
            possible! Everyday I look for new ways to bring code
            into my environment. Coming up with new ways to solve
            daily challenges whenever it's possible.

            Since I was a child, I have been fascinated with coding
            and have always wondered how the gears work in the video
            games I played. Over time, that mystery became clear and
            I had to learn more about it.
