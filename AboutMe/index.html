        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
            Since I was a child, I have been fascinated with coding and have always wondered how the gears work in the video games I
            play. Over time, that mystery became clear and I had to learn more about it. For example, to create a game like Call Of
            Duty you will need models, music, sound effects, and animations. Then there is code to tie it all together. It sounds
            simple, but that isn't the case. Each branch has multiple parts to it which would take many hours to learn just for that
            one section. So what did I do? Pick one subject to focus on? That's what a smart person would do. No! I attempted to
            learn them all. I fell down a rabbit hole and gave up on that dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I got older and wiser. Upon reflection, I realized I was terrible at modeling and animation. I'm talented at music
            and sound effects but I'm a master at coding. That's when it hit me. I don't care about creating games. I love creating
            logic. So I must devote all my attention to coding. Got sucked down another rabbit hole with YouTube but this time it
            was different. I was learning but the things I was learning didn't have any structure or use for me. Since I needed
            skills to be able to join a gaming studio. I decided to join a coding boot camp.
        </p>
        <P>
            So who am I? I'm Jamaria! A full-stack developer on a mission to change the world line by line. I like to refer to
            coding as magic because with coding, anything is possible! Everyday I look for creative ways to bring code into my
            environment. Coming up with new ways to solve daily challenges whenever it's possible.
